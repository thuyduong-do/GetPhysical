## this is my program 
**It was supposed to be a get physical address program but i could not complete it**
- first we create a new process 
- then get info from the location called ipconfig.exe 
- get all info using /all 

- RedirectStandardOutput so that it cant be assigned any value

- CreateNoWindow so that the data gathered wont be opened in another window but opened in our console  
- then we create an array of string to store data, lines by lines , removing all empty lines that doesnt contain any characters
